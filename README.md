## 📦 Quick Start

### 1. Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openbmb/edgeclaw.git
cd edgeclaw

pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 2. Launch

```bash
node openclaw.mjs gateway run
```

> EdgeClaw uses `~/.edgeclaw/` as the data directory by default, completely isolated from OpenClaw (`~/.openclaw/`). To customize the path, set the `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` environment variable.

**On first launch**, a complete configuration skeleton is auto-generated (`~/.edgeclaw/openclaw.json` + `clawxrouter.json`), with ClawXRouter and ClawXMemory as bundled extensions — no manual plugin installation required.

### 3. Fill in API Key

The generated config has empty API Keys. Fill them in to get started:

- **Edit the config file**: Modify the `apiKey` for each provider under `models.providers` in `~/.edgeclaw/openclaw.json`
- **Dashboard hot-reload**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:18790/plugins/clawxrouter/stats` and modify directly in the UI — changes take effect immediately

> Tip: Setting the `EDGECLAW_API_KEY` environment variable before launch will auto-fill it.

### 4. Verify

```bash
node openclaw.mjs agent --local --agent main -m "Hello"
```

When you see `[ClawXrouter] token-saver: S1 redirect →` and an agent reply, the deployment is successful.

### Dashboard

## 🧠 ClawXMemory — Multi-Layered Long-Term Memory System

Developers who have used Claude Code know: what truly makes it indispensable isn't how good any single answer is, but that **it remembers you** — your coding style, project architecture, last week's discussion, even your preferred naming conventions.

**[ClawXMemory](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ClawXMemory) is the first plugin to bring Claude Code-like memory capabilities to the OpenClaw ecosystem.**

| Core Memory Capability          | Standard OpenClaw | Claude Code    | ClawXMemory                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Cross-session project knowledge | ✗                 | ✓              | ✓                                         |
| Persistent user preference      | ✗                 | ✓              | ✓                                         |
| Multi-layered structured memory | ✗                 | ✓              | ✓                                         |
| Memory integration strategy     | Recall            | On-demand read | Proactive reasoning                       |
| Continuous memory consolidation | ✗                 | Auto-Dream     | Auto-consolidation on idle & topic switch |

### Three-Layer Memory Architecture

The system automatically distills information during conversations, building structured memory layer by layer:

| Memory Layer | Type                             | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L2**       | Project memory / Timeline memory | High-level long-term memory aggregated around specific topics or timelines |
| **L1**       | Memory fragments                 | Structured core summaries distilled from concluded topics                  |
| **L0**       | Raw conversations                | The lowest-level raw message records                                       |
| **Global**   | User profile                     | A continuously updated global user preference singleton                    |

When the model needs to recall, it **proactively navigates along the "memory tree" through reasoning** — first evaluating relevance from high-level memory (project/timeline/profile), drilling down into finer-grained fragments only when needed, and tracing back to specific conversations when necessary. This is closer to how a human expert reasons layer by layer than traditional vector retrieval.

### Core Features

- **Automatic memory construction**: No manual maintenance needed — automatically distills, aggregates, and updates during conversation
- **Model-driven retrieval**: Uses reasoning instead of matching, truly understanding vague questions like "How is this project progressing?"
- **Memory visualization Dashboard**: Canvas view and list view, with memory layers and relationships at a glance
- **Local storage, privacy-safe**: SQLite by default, data never leaves the device, supports one-click import/export

## 🔌 ClawXRouter — Edge-Cloud Collaborative Routing Plugin

[ClawXRouter](https://github.com/openbmb/clawxrouter) is EdgeClaw's routing brain — the edge perceives data attributes (sensitivity, complexity) while the cloud handles reasoning and generation. Through its Hook mechanism, it automatically intercepts and routes without any changes to business code, serving as a seamless drop-in replacement for OpenClaw.

### Cost-Aware Routing (Token-Saver)

Most requests involve browsing files, reading code, and simple Q&A — using the most expensive model for these tasks is pure waste. Token-Saver uses LLM-as-Judge to classify requests by complexity, automatically routing them to the most economical model:

| Complexity    | Task Examples                                             | Default Target Model |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **SIMPLE**    | Queries, translation, formatting, greetings               | `gpt-4o-mini`        |
| **MEDIUM**    | Code generation, single-file editing, email drafting      | `gpt-4o`             |
| **COMPLEX**   | System design, multi-file refactoring, cross-doc analysis | `claude-sonnet-4.6`  |
| **REASONING** | Mathematical proofs, formal logic, experiment design      | `o4-mini`            |

| Approach         | Pros                                     | Cons                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Keyword Rules    | Fast                                     | No semantic understanding, high false-positive rate |
| **LLM-as-Judge** | **Semantic understanding, multilingual** | One additional local model call (~1–2s)             |

The Judge runs on a local small model (MiniCPM-4.1 / Qwen3.5), with prompt hash caching (SHA-256, TTL 5 min) to avoid re-judging identical requests. In typical workflows, **60–80% of requests** are forwarded to cheaper models.

### Three-Tier Security Collaboration (Privacy Router)

Every message, tool call, and tool result is inspected in real time and automatically classified into three levels:

| Level  | Meaning   | Routing Strategy                  | Example                          |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **S1** | Safe      | Send directly to cloud model      | "Write a poem about spring"      |
| **S2** | Sensitive | Desensitize then forward to cloud | Addresses, phone numbers, emails |
| **S3** | Private   | Process locally only              | Pay slips, passwords, SSH keys   |

**Dual Detection Engines**: Rule detector (keywords + regex, ~0ms) + Local LLM detector (semantic understanding, ~1–2s) — the two can be combined and stacked.

**S2 Desensitized Forwarding**:

```
User Message (containing PII) → Local LLM Detection → S2 → Extract PII → Replace with [REDACTED:*]
    → Privacy Proxy → Strip markers → Forward to cloud → Pass through SSE response
```

**S3 Fully Local**: Forwarded to the local Guard Agent (Ollama / vLLM); cloud-side history only receives a placeholder.

**Dual-Track Memory & Dual-Track Sessions**:

```
~/.edgeclaw/workspace/
├── MEMORY.md           ← What the cloud model sees (auto-desensitized)
├── MEMORY-FULL.md      ← What the local model sees (complete data)
│
agents/{id}/sessions/
├── full/               ← Complete history (including Guard Agent interactions)
└── clean/              ← Clean history (for cloud model consumption)
```

The cloud model **never sees** `MEMORY-FULL.md` or `sessions/full/` — the Hook system intercepts at the file access layer.

### Composable Router Pipeline

The security router and cost-aware router run in the **same pipeline**, working together via weights and a two-phase short-circuit strategy:

```
User Message
    │
    ▼
RouterPipeline.run()
    │
    ├── Phase 1: Fast routers (weight ≥ 50) run in parallel
    │       └── privacy router → three-tier sensitivity detection
    │
    ├── Short-circuit: If Phase 1 detects sensitive data → skip Phase 2
    │
    └── Phase 2: Slow routers (weight < 50) run on demand
            └── token-saver → LLM Judge complexity classification
```

Security first — the security router runs first with high weight. If sensitive data is found, it short-circuits immediately. Cost-aware routing kicks in only after the security check passes (S1).

### 13 Hooks Covering the Complete Lifecycle

| Hook                   | Trigger Point              | Core Responsibility                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `before_model_resolve` | Before model selection     | Run pipeline → routing decision             |
| `before_prompt_build`  | Before prompt construction | Inject Guard Prompt / S2 markers            |
| `before_tool_call`     | Before tool invocation     | File access guard + sub-agent guard         |
| `after_tool_call`      | After tool invocation      | Tool result detection                       |
| `tool_result_persist`  | Result persistence         | Dual-track session write                    |
| `before_message_write` | Before message write       | S3 → placeholder, S2 → desensitized version |
| `session_end`          | Session ends               | Memory synchronization                      |
| `message_sending`      | Outbound message           | Detect and desensitize/cancel               |
| `before_agent_start`   | Before sub-agent starts    | Task content guard                          |
| `message_received`     | Message received           | Observability logging                       |

      "keywords": {
        "S2": ["password", "api_key", "token"],
        "S3": ["ssh", "id_rsa", "private_key", ".pem"]
      },
      "patterns": {
        "S2": ["(?:mysql|postgres|mongodb)://[^\\s]+"],
        "S3": ["-----BEGIN (?:RSA |EC )?PRIVATE KEY-----"]
      },
      "tools": {

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Detector Composition

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "checkpoints": {
      "onUserMessage": ["ruleDetector", "localModelDetector"],
      "onToolCallProposed": ["ruleDetector"],
      "onToolCallExecuted": ["ruleDetector"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Routers

The ClawXRouter pipeline is fully extensible — implement the `GuardClawRouter` interface to inject custom routing logic:

```typescript
const myRouter: GuardClawRouter = {
  id: "content-filter",
  async detect(context, pluginConfig): Promise<RouterDecision> {
    if (context.message && context.message.length > 10000) {
      return {
        level: "S1",
        action: "redirect",
        target: { provider: "anthropic", model: "claude-sonnet-4.6" },
        reason: "Message too long, using larger context model",
      };
    }
    return { level: "S1", action: "passthrough" };
  },
};
```

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "routers": {
      "content-filter": {
        "enabled": true,
        "type": "custom",
        "module": "./my-routers/content-filter.js",
        "weight": 40
      }
    },
    "pipeline": {
      "onUserMessage": ["privacy", "token-saver", "content-filter"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Prompt Customization

Edit the Markdown files under `extensions/clawxrouter/prompts/` to adjust behavior — no code changes needed:

| File                    | Purpose                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `detection-system.md`   | S1/S2/S3 classification rules  |
| `guard-agent-system.md` | Guard Agent behavior           |
| `token-saver-judge.md`  | Task complexity classification |

### Provider Preset Quick Switch

Built-in presets allow one-click switching between local model + cloud model combinations:

| Preset          | Local Model         | Cloud Model        | Use Case                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `vllm-qwen35`   | vLLM / Qwen 3.5-35B | Same (fully local) | Full local deployment, maximum privacy        |
| `minimax-cloud` | vLLM / Qwen 3.5-35B | MiniMax M2.5       | Local privacy detection + cloud primary model |

Custom presets for Ollama, LMStudio, SGLang, and other backends are also supported.
